# Metagenomic_notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks provide ways of quickly processing large numbers of files containing metagenome- and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) data, including sequence depth (coverage) values, logitudinal data, etc. 

I am just beginning to populate this repository. Please contact me at nvpatin@gmail.com for any questions.
