# Metagenome notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks provide ways to quickly process large files containing metagenome- and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) data, including sequence depth (coverage) values, logitudinal data, functional annotations, etc. 

I am just beginning to populate this repository. Please contact me at nvpatin@gmail.com for any questions.
